#Deployment

    Saved Search: Save this as a scheduled search in Splunk (e.g., run every 15 minutes) with an alert action (e.g., email, Slack) for risk_score > 50.
    Dashboard: Add to a SOC dashboard with a table visualization, filtering by risk_score for real-time monitoring.
    Performance: For large datasets, consider accelerating underlying data models (e.g., Network_Traffic, Authentication) and swapping stats for tstats where possible.
