Computes aggregates (e.g., totals, averages) and adds them to each event without grouping, unlike stats
Flags individual firewall events where data transfer exceeds twice the average for that source IP, spotting outliers without losing event details.

index=security sourcetype=firewall | eventstats avg(bytes) as avg_bytes by src_ip | where bytes > avg_bytes * 2


Maps proxy traffic origins to identify clusters of suspicious activity (e.g., unexpected countries).

index=security sourcetype=proxy | geostats count by src_ip | where count > 100


Runs multiple searches concurrently, merging results for cross-source analysis.
Correlates blocked firewall events with IDS malware alerts by source IP, revealing multi-layered attacks.

| stats count by src_ip


Tracks login attempts per user sequentially, flagging those exceeding 5 tries for potential brute force.

index=security sourcetype=auth | streamstats count as attempt_number by user | where attempt_number > 5


Detects rare user agents in web logs, potentially indicating reconnaissance or malware.

index=security sourcetype=web | rare user_agent | where count < 5
